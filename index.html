<h2>All about me</h2>
<p>Hi my full name is Eve Berube. I Am 14 years old and I am a CRLS student. At home I live with my mom, dad, older bother and our dog Luna! My family and I all immigrate from Canada to the US for my dads job.</p>

<p>As a person I see myself as a caring kind person, at first I tend to be shy but after knowing me for a bit I tend to open up more. People tend to discribe me as very introverted, but once they know me better I tend to be very open, some people I just click with but sometimes it takes more time</p>

<h3>My Career Aspirations</h3>

<p>As I grow older I tend to stat thinking more about my future and what I will be pursing for my career. As of now I want to be a nurse when im older or just work in the medical field. Ive always loved helping people so I would love to have that as a day to day job!</p>
