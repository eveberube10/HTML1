<h1><em>Climate change</em> in Canada</h1>

<img src="https://media.tacdn.com/media/attractions-content--1x-1/11/cb/63/a8.jpg" alt="Canada" width="700">

<h3>How has Canada already been impacted?</h3>
<p>Canada is <strong>already</strong> experiencing climate change, some examples would be sea levels rising,<br> temperatures rising, the weather is getting more extreme and eco systems are changing. <br> A good example would be the forest fires we had in canada last summer and the crazy high temperatures.<br> Equally important the arctic is melting, proving my first point on the water levels rising.   </p>

<h2>How will Canada be impacted in the future?</h2>

<p>Adding on to what I mentioned earlier in the canada will probably face more wildfires. canada <br> will also most definetly face more extreme weathers and water levels will be heavily rising. <br> More heatwaves are to come resulting in more possible health risks for canadians.</p>

<h3>What can be done to minimize the impact of climate change?</h3>

<ul>
   <li>reduce greenhouse gases</li>
   <li>protect the ecosytem</li>
   <li>reduce waste</li>
   <li>make more climate <em>Friendly</em> policies to follow</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are the people in the area <strong>already</strong> doing to limit the impact of climate change?</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Using renewable energy</li>
   <li>Using alot of public transportation</li>
   <li>having sustainable agriculture</li>
</ul>
